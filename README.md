* Install [Python](http://www.python.org/download/).
* Download [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php)
	* Windows users: do not use the MSI. Instead download the zip-file and extract it next to `cyoa_compiler.py`.
	* Mac users: just install the package and it should just work.
* Either:
	* Run (often double-click) `cyoa_compiler.py`. A GUI will pop up.
